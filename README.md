# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning system to predict whether a person has diabetes. Utilizing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, the system analyzes medical data to make classifications.

## Workflow

**1. Data Collection:** Diabetes data is gathered for model training.

**2. Data Pre-processing:** Before feeding the data to the model, it is preprocessed to ensure uniformity across attributes.

**3. Data Splitting:** The data is split into training and test sets to train the machine learning model and evaluate its performance.

**4. Model Training:** The SVM model is trained using the training data.

**5. Accuracy Evaluation:** The model's accuracy is evaluated using the traning and testing data.

**6. Prediction:** Once trained, the model can accurately predict whether a new individual is diabetic or non-diabetic.
