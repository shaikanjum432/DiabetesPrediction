**PIMS Diabetes Prediction**

**Overview**

This project focuses on building a predictive model for diabetes using the PIMS Diabetes Dataset. The goal is to train a machine learning model to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on various health-related features.

**Dependencies**

This project is implemented in Python and utilizes the following libraries:

numpy for numerical operations

pandas for data manipulation

scikit-learn for machine learning tasks

StandardScaler for data standardization

train_test_split for splitting the dataset

svm.SVC for Support Vector Machine classification

accuracy_score for evaluating model performance

**Data Collection and Analysis**

**Dataset**

The PIMS Diabetes Dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. It consists of 768 samples with 9 features, including information about pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and more.

**Statistical Measures**

Statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, and quartiles are calculated to better understand the dataset.

**Data Visualization**

The distribution of diabetic and non-diabetic cases is visualized, providing insights into the class balance.

**Data Preprocessing**

**Standardization**

Data is standardized using StandardScaler to ensure consistent scales for features, a crucial step for many machine learning algorithms.

**Model Training and Evaluation**

**Train-Test Split**

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train the model on one subset and evaluate its performance on another.

**Support Vector Machine Classifier**

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel is trained on the standardized data.

**Model Evaluation**

The accuracy score is calculated for both the training and test datasets to assess the model's performance.

**Making Predictions**

A predictive system is implemented, allowing users to input new data for prediction. The model predicts whether an individual is diabetic or not based on the provided features.
